##A Tale of Three Lists

This is a vanilla js implementation of the tale of three lists challenge by getify. (See https://github.com/getify/A-Tale-Of-Three-Lists)
This is an alternative to the TodoMVC sample application for demonstrating asynchronous coding principles. 
I pulled in rxjs to handle the asynchronous behavior (so not completely vanilla)

This is probably not cross-browser compatible, as I used CSS grids to get the layout right.

To run the demo (node and npm are prerequisites):
Clone the repository
Run `npm install`
Run `npm start`
The application should open in a browser window
